# SoftUni-Python-Basic-Web-Development

In this, we will lay the foundations of Web programming with Python and Django. We'll look at how networks actually work, what HTTP is, and what the basic principles of web development are. We will learn to work with databases and write basic SQL queries using pgAdmin. In the course, we will look at the main concepts in the MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture, and in addition to them, for application development we will use forms (Form and ModelForm), we will work with media files, and we will store the data in PostgreSQL. The training includes practical laboratory exercises (labs) and workshops for building complete, fully functional Django web applications.
