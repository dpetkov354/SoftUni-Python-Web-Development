# SoftUni-Python-Web-Development

In this, we will lay the foundations of Web programming with Python and Django. We'll look at how networks actually work, what HTTP is, and what the basic principles of web development are. We will learn to work with databases and write basic SQL queries using pgAdmin. In the course, we will look at the main concepts in the MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture, and in addition to them, for application development we will use forms (Form and ModelForm), we will work with media files, and we will store the data in PostgreSQL. The training includes practical laboratory exercises (labs) and workshops for building complete, fully functional Django web applications.

In the "Python Web Framework" course, we will go into the details of web programming with Python using one of the most popular Python Frameworks - Django. We will build our knowledge of Views through CBV. We will learn how to register, log in and log out users. Additionally, we will address security as well as the ins and outs of developing dynamic web applications. We'll also get to know the Django REST Framework. We will learn the basic concepts of Unit and Integration Testing and clarify the best practices for testing a web application. During the course, we will practice what we have learned by hands-on building a complete web application.
